    title: About me
    summary: |
       Greetings from Bo! Welcome to my website.
       I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Jinli Suo and co-advised by Prof. Qionghai Dai.
       I received B.S. in Measurement, Control Technology and Instruments and B.S. in Economics from Tsinghua University in 2018. 
       My research interests lie in computer vision and computational imaging.
       
       I like doing sports in my spare time. Badminton, tennis, running and swimming are my favorites.

        # link: "#hook"
        tagline: "We built a portable setup being able to capture pixel-level registered bright-dark pair simultaneously, 
        which is applicable for both static and dynamic scenes. Using this setup, we collected a large, paired, annotated 
        and high-quality low-light dataset for low-light image restoration and object detection based on image and video."
